TableMorph ClipboardRead Permission Justification

Extension: TableMorph
Version: 1.0

Permission: clipboardRead

Justification:
TableMorph requires clipboardRead permission to fulfill its core functionality of table data format conversion. Without this permission, the extension cannot access copied table data, making conversion impossible.

Usage:
User copies table data, clicks conversion button. Extension reads clipboard using navigator.clipboard.read(), detects format, converts to target format, writes result back.

Why Necessary:
TableMorph operates entirely through clipboard operations. Extension needs to read both HTML and plain text formats to support various table sources.

Privacy:
Extension only reads clipboard when user explicitly triggers conversion. All processing is local. No data transmission or storage.
